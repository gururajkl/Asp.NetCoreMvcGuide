* To start with Identity - Click on Add and click on New Scaffolded Item and Select Idenity.

* Then The DbContext class should implement 'IdentityDbContext' instead of 'DbContext'

* By making sure the above step, then we can select the DbContext class from the drop down.

* Select the required files to add/override.

* After adding all the files, ASP.Net will create a new Identity folder with razor syntax.

(Make sure all the Nuget packages are in the same version - if you get error).

* To add the IdentityRole in the application change the DefaultIdentity to Identity and include IdentityRole.

* You can see all the register and login etc,.

* Since this uses Razor pages make sure these lines are there in the program.cs
// Support of razor pages
builder.Services.AddRazorPages();
app.MapRazorPages();

* I have addedd all the logic to create a custom roles in Register page.

* If it is necessary to create the user with custom field including identity user checkout ApplicationUser.cs in Model project.

* If some URL is redirecting properly after the Authorization in the app, checkout 'Configure app cookie' in program.cs
